# Python - Almost a circle

> This project was a general review of previous python concepts, as well as `args` and `kwargs`, Serialization/Deserialization and JSON.

## Summary

I learnt about Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project, how to serialize and deserialize a Class, how to write and read a JSON file, what  `*args` and `**kwargs` are and how to use them, and how to handle named arguments in a function.

## Files
