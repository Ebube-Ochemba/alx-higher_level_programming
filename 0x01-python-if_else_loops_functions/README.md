# Python - if/else, loops, functions

> This project was an introduction to more fundamental concepts and syntax in Python programming.

## Introduction

I learnt about conditionals and loops in Python. `if`, `if ... else`, `break`, `continue`, `pass`, and `range` statements with `while` and `for loops`. I also wrote my own Python functions and learnt about scope of variables, tracebacks, and arithmetic operators.
