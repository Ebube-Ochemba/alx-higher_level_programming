> This project was introduction classes and objects in Python.

## Summary

I learnt about OOP, what is a class, an object and an instance, the difference between a class and an object or instance. What is an attribute and how to use public, protected and private attributes. What is `self`, a method and the special `__init__` method and how to use it. What is Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding. What is a property, the difference between an attribute and a property in Python. What is the Pythonic way to write getters and setters in Python. How to dynamically create arbitrary new attributes for existing instances of a class. How to bind attributes to object and classes. What is the `__dict__` of a class and/or instance of a class and what does it contain. How does Python find the attributes of an object or class and how to use the getattr function.
